      <p>Zion hear me! It is true what many of you have heard. The machines 
        have gathered an army and as I speak that army is drawing nearer to 
        our home. Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us 
        but if we are to be prepared for it we must first shed our fear of 
        it.<br>I stand hear before you now truly unafraid! Why?! Because I 
        believe something you do not? No! I stand here without fear because 
        I remember. I remember that I am hear not because of the path that 
        lay before me.. but because of the path that lies behind me! I 
        remember that for one hundred years we have fought these machines! 
        I remember that for one-hundred years they have sent their armies 
        to destroy us and after a century of war I remember that which 
        matters most! We are still here! tonight let us send a message to 
        that army! Let us shake this cave! Tonight let us tremble these 
        walls of earth, steel and stone! Let us be heard from red core to 
        black sky! Tonight let us make them remember this is Zion and we 
        are not afraid!</p>
